.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm honk
.Nd honk administration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon processes messages from other federated servers.
This is the admin manual.
For user operation, see
.Xr honk 1 .
.Ss Setup
.Pp
Set up a TLS reverse proxy.
.Nm
can listen on TCP or unix sockets, but will not terminate TLS.
https is a required component for federation.
Also, http signature verification requires accurate time keeping.
.Pp
Make sure to pass the Host header, if necessary (as for nginx).
.Bd -literal -offset indent
proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
.Ed
.Ss Build
Building
.Nm
requires a go compiler 1.13 and libsqlite.
On
.Ox
this is the go and sqlite3 packages.
Other platforms may require additional development libraries or headers
to be installed.
Run make.
Please be patient.
Even on fast machines, building from source can take several seconds.
.Ss Options
The following options control where
.Nm
looks for data.
.Bl -tag -width datadirx
.It Fl datadir
The root data directory, where the database and other user data are stored.
This directory contains all user data that persists across upgrades.
Requires write access.
Defaults to ".".
.It Fl viewdir
The root view directory, where html and other templates are stored.
The contents of this directory are generally replaced with each release.
Read only.
Defaults to ".".
.El
.Ss Init
Run the
.Ic init
command.
This will create the database and ask four questions, as well as creating
the initial user.
See below about importing existing data.
.Ss Operation
Run honk.
Log messages are sent to stderr and should probably be redirected to a file.
.Ss Customization
The funzone contains fun flair that users may add to posts and profiles.
Add custom memes (stickers) to the
.Pa memes
data directory.
Image and video files are supported.
Add custom emus (emoji) to the
.Pa emus
data directory.
PNG files are supported.
.Pp
Site CSS may be overridden by creating a
.Pa views/local.css
file in the data directory.
A restart is required after changes.
.Pp
Custom HTML messages may be added to select pages by using the
.Ic admin
command.
This interface is a little rough.
A restart is required after changes.
.Bl -tag -width tenletters
.It server
Displayed on the home page.
.It about
Displayed on the about page.
.It login
Displayed on the login form.
.It avatar colors
Four 32-bit hex colors (RGBA).
.El
.Pp
.Ss User Admin
New users can be added with the
.Ic adduser
command.
This is discouraged.
.Pp
Passwords may be reset with the
.Ic chpass Ar username
command.
.Pp
Users may be deleted with the
.Ic deluser Ar username
command.
.Ss Maintenance
The database may grow large over time.
The
.Ic cleanup Op Ar days
command exists to purge old external data, by default 30 days.
This removes unreferenced, unsaved posts and attachments.
It does not remove any original content.
.Pp
Backups may be performed by running
.Ic backup dirname .
Backups only include the minimal necessary information, such as user posts
and follower information, but not external posts.
.Ss Upgrade
Stop the old honk process.
Backup the database.
Perform the upgrade with the
.Ic upgrade
command.
Restart.
.Pp
The current version of the honk binary may be printed with the
.Ic version
command.
.Ss unplug
Sometimes servers simply disappear, resulting in many errors trying to deliver
undeliverable messages.
Running
.Ic unplug Ar hostname
will delete all subscriptions and pending deliveries.
.Ss Security
.Nm
is not currently hardened against SSRF, server side request forgery.
Be mindful of what other services may be exposed via localhost or the
local network.
.Ss Debug
Debug mode may be enabled or disabled by running
.Ic debug Ar on|off .
In debug mode, secure cookies are disabled and templates are reloaded
every request.
Debug mode is really more useful for development, not debugging production.
.Ss Import
Data may be imported and converted from other services using the
.Ic import
command.
Posts are imported and backdated to appear as old honks.
No other information is imported.
Currently supports Mastodon and Twitter exported data.
.Pp
To prepare a Mastodon data archive, extract the archive-longhash.tar.gz file.
.Dl ./honk import username mastodon source-directory
.Pp
To prepare a Twitter data archive, extract the twitter-longhash.zip file.
After unzipping the data archive, navigate to the tweet_media directory
and unzip any zip files contained within.
.Dl ./honk import username twitter source-directory
.Ss Advanced Options
To support separate mentions without a subdomain,
e.g. @user@example.com and https://honk.example.com/u/user,
add a ('masqname', 'example.com') row to the config table of the database.
Route
.Pa /.well-known/webfinger
from the top domain to honk.
.Pp
Custom URL seperators (not "u" and "h") may be specified by adding
"usersep" and "honksep" options to the config table.
e.g. example.com/users/username/honk/somehonk instead of
example.com/u/username/h/somehonk.
.Sh FILES
.Nm
files are split between the data directory and the view directory.
Both default to "." but may be specified by command line options.
.Pp
The data directory contains:
.Bl -tag -width views/local.css
.It Pa honk.db
The main database.
.It Pa blob.db
Media and attachment storage.
.It Pa emus
Custom emoji.
.It Pa memes
Stickers and such.
.It Pa views/local.css
Locally customized CSS.
.El
.Pp
The view directory contains:
.Bl -tag -width views
.It Pa views
HTML templates and CSS files.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
This series of commands creates a new database, sets a friendly
welcome message, and runs honk.
