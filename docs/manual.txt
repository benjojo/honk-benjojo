Instructions for using honk.

This is the user manual. Please refer to admin.txt for administration.

-- posting

Should work as expected.

Limited markdown support:
	**bold** and *italics*
	`code` and ```code block```
	> quote

Large images are rescaled and reduced.

The honk back button will prefill the forms for replies.

-- sensitive honks

A honk that begins with the danger zone indication, DZ:, will be marked
sensitive, using the first line as a summary (spoiler text).

-- following

In order to follow somebody, you need to enter one of two identifiers.

The easiest is probably their handle, the thing that resembles an email.
@name@example.com for example.

Alternatively, one may directly enter the actor ID, which is a URL that looks
like https://example.com/users/name.

Followed honkers may be assigned to combos, listing all their honks together.

Followed honkers will appear on the main feedtube unless silenced. Honkers may
be silenced by adding them to a combo named "-". (One dash.)

Selecting just peeping won't actually follow them. (Incomplete feature.)
Can be useful for managing as part of a combo, however.

-- xzone

Individual honks may be manually fetched via the xzone.

Additionally, entering a honker URL will fetch all their recent honks.

A list of recently known honkers will appear as well.

-- zonking

You can zonk anything you like (or dislike), either your own honk or
those of others that you're tired of seeing. Be advised that deletion
works poorly in a federated environment. It's more like please disregard.

The zonkzone supports muting unwanted contacts. One may mute an actor
(zonker), a domain (zomain), thread (zonvoy), or word (zord).

Posts can be collapsed, but not hidden, by specifying a zilence regex.

-- privacy

Posted honks are public. The federated environment lacks robust privacy
controls.

Received messages are only visible when logged in, regardless of addressing.
Content from outside is not publicly rehosted, unless bonked.

Received messages that are less than public are tagged with a red border.
As a special exception to the public honking rule, replies to limited messages
will be restricted as much as possible. Note that ActivityPub leaks. Do
not use honk for posting truly private information.

-- emus and memes

A list of available emus and memes appears in the funzone.

Emus such as :example: will be inlined into posts.

Memes such as `meme: example.mp4` will be appended to posts.

-- hoots

Link and inline a hoot and replies from that other bird site.

-- cleanup

One should occasionally run `honk cleanup` to free up internal space in the
database. This deletes honks older than 30 days, but not those posted by a
user.

One may also run `honk reduce [honker]` to delete honks older than 3 days.
This is useful to reduce the space requirements from following image bots.

(Neither command runs vacuum, so the file size will not immediately shrink.)

-- add user

Running `honk adduser` can add additional users. This is discouraged.

-- proxy

honk requires a TLS terminating reverse proxy be configured. It communicates
with other servers via https URLs.

If the proxy is configured to support caching, be mindful of the fact that
ActivityPub requests vary based on the Accept and Content-Type headers.

ActivityPub in practice uses HTTP signatures to verify requests. In order for
this to work, the backend server must receive certain header fields
unmodified. In particular, the Host header and the message content cannot be
altered.

Specifically, for nginx: `proxy_set_header Host $http_host;`
