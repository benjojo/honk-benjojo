Minimal setup and configuration.

Written in gotesque, an especially grotesque dialect of golang.

-- build

It should be sufficient to type make after unpacking a release.
You'll need a go compiler version 1.11 or later.

Even on a fast machine, building from source can take several seconds.

-- requirements

libsqlite3 (you probably already have it)

go 1.11+

Internet connection not included.

-- setup

honk expects to be fronted by a TLS terminating reverse proxy.

First, create the database. This will ask four questions.

./honk init

username: (the username you want)
password: (the password you want)
listenaddr: (tcp or unix: localhost:31337, /var/www/honk.sock, etc.)
servername: (public DNS name: honk.example.com)

Then run honk.

./honk

Refer also to the docs directory, in particular manual.txt.

Busy honk instances may use megabytes of memory.

-- upgrade

cp honk.db backup.db

./honk upgrade

./honk
