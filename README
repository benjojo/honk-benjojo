honk

-- features

Take control of your honks.

An ActivityPub server focused on minimal setup and support costs.
Spend more time using the software and less time operating it.

No attention mining.
No likes, no faves, no polls, no stars, no claps, no counts.

Purple color scheme. Custom emus. Memes too.
Avatars automatically assigned by the NSA.

The button to submit a new honk says "it's gonna be honked".

-- build

It should be sufficient to type make after unpacking a release.
You'll need a go compiler version 1.11 or later.

Even on a fast machine, building from source can take several seconds.

Development sources: hg clone https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/honk

-- setup

honk expects to be fronted by a TLS terminating reverse proxy.

First, create the database. This will ask four questions.
./honk init
username: (the username you want)
password: (the password you want)
listenaddr: (tcp or unix: localhost:31337, /var/www/honk.sock, etc.)
servername: (public DNS name: honk.example.com)

Then run honk.
./honk

-- upgrade

cp honk.db backup.db
./honk upgrade
./honk

-- documentation

There is a more complete incomplete manual. This is just the README.
